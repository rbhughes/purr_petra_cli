How to Achieve Global CLI Installation with uv
Initialize your project as an app and package:

uv init --app --package hello_cli
Ensure your pyproject.toml defines the CLI entry point:

[project.scripts]
hello-cli = "hello:main"
(Replace "hello:main" with the actual module and function.)


Install your CLI globally:

uv tool install . -e
This command installs your CLI tool in "editable" mode, making it available system-wide.



Invoke your CLI from anywhere:

hello-cli
After this installation, hello-cli will be available on your system PATH, so you can call it directly from any terminal windowâ€”no need to prefix with uv run or activate a specific environment.

This method is the most accepted approach for globally available Python CLI apps using uv, and it works seamlessly with Typer-based projects as well.
