Petra's concept of perfs is less 'overwrought' than geographix. The sensible
thing is to consider common dates to signify a single completion event. The
completion may even be indicated by the API number's last 4 digits:
0001, 0002, 0003 signify recompletions
maybe in 11th position like 0100 if it's a horizontal well"
